        "Suppose we wish to invest $\\$19,000$. We have identified four investment opportunities. Investment 1 requires an investment of $\\$6,700$ and has a net present value of $\\$8,000$; investment 2 requires $\\$10,000$ and has a value of $\\$11,000$; investment 3 requires $\\$5,500$ and has a value of $\\$6,000$; and investment 4 requires $\\$3,400$ and has a value of $\\$4,000$. Into which investments should we place our money so as to maximize our total present value? Each project is a ''take it or leave it'' opportunity: It is not allowed to invest partially in any of the projects. Such problems are called capital budgeting problems. As in linear programming, our first step is to decide on the variables. In this case, it is easy: We will use a $0-1$ variable $x_j$ for each investment. If $x_j$ is $1$ then we will make investment $j$. If it is $0$, we will not make the investment. This leads to the $0-1$ programming problem"
